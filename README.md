# DriverPass System Design Reflection

## Summary of DriverPass Project  
DriverPass was the client for this project. They wanted to create a better system to help students prepare for their DMV driving tests. The system needed to support both in-person driving lessons and online study tools. It also needed to handle scheduling, progress tracking, and account management. The goal was to make it easier for students to pass their tests by improving how they study and practice.

## What I Did Well  
I think I did a good job breaking down the client’s needs into clear and organized requirements. My diagrams were also clean and helped show the flow of the system.

## What I Would Revise  
If I had more time, I would go back and improve the requirements section of the system design document. I would make it more detailed by explaining how the system could handle unexpected downtime. I would also try to be more specific about the security features, especially when it comes to protecting user data.

## How I Met User Needs in the Design  
To understand the user’s needs, I really focused on the pain points mentioned by DriverPass. They were frustrated that students were not prepared enough for the test, so I designed features like practice tests and progress tracking. I also thought about different users like students, admins, and instructors to make sure each one had the tools they needed. Thinking about the user is important because if the system is not helpful or easy to use, then people will not want to use it.

## My Approach to Designing Software  
When I design software, I start by asking what the user really needs and what problems the system is solving. I like to break things into smaller parts so I can focus on each one clearly. In the future, I want to keep using tools like UML diagrams and business requirement templates. These help organize my thoughts and communicate ideas clearly. I also want to get better at using feedback from users and teammates to improve my designs.
